## 🧩 File Descriptions

### 🎇 `LeapYearCheckerFinal.java`
- A standalone GUI that checks if a year is a leap year.  
- Includes animated glowing buttons, floating particle effects, and sound feedback.  
- Updated for **Hacktoberfest 2025** to include comments, styling, and a “Clear” button feature.

---

### 🎵 `Player.java`
- Core **backend class** for a simple media player application.  
- Handles music playback, control, and resource management.  
- Designed to work with `PlayerGUI.java` and `PlayerMain.java`.

---

### 🪟 `PlayerGUI.java`
- Front-end GUI for the audio player.  
- Provides buttons, labels, and controls to play, pause, and stop tracks.  
- Connects to `Player.java` for playback logic.  
- Has a corresponding `.form` file that defines its visual layout.

---

### 🧭 `PlayerMain.java`
- Entry point for the music player program.  
- Initializes the GUI and launches the main player window.  
- Keeps the project modular and easy to test separately.

---

### 📋 `ListFrame.java`
- Supplementary frame used for displaying or managing lists (like track lists).  
- Works as a component within the player GUI.  
- The `.form` file defines its layout visually using an IDE like NetBeans.

---

### 🧱 `.form` Files
- Example: `ListFrame.form`, `PlayerGUI.form`  
- These files store layout metadata generated by GUI builders (like **NetBeans Form Designer**).  
- They describe positions, colors, fonts, and design properties for GUI components.

---

### ⚙️ `requirements.txt`
- Contains dependencies or setup notes (if any).  
- Since this is a Java Swing project, it may list version requirements or optional libraries.

---

### 📝 `README.md`
- Documentation file (this one).  
- Provides an overview of the folder layout and explains the purpose of each file.
